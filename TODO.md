# TODO

- changing filters should not cause torrents to be seen

- maybe deprioritize the "Make Default" button. this feels like a rare thing and
  is destructive.

- saved tag sets

- release minified and unminified versions. the minified version should be the
  default choice for users. if problems arise, the unminified version can be
  used to get more helpful stack traces for debugging.
