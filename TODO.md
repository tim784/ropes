# TODO

- put images (gifs?) in the README

- radius for everything

- finish reworking the mounting:

  - make sure all our CSS is inside our components. leave no trace.
  - mess with emitCss on svelte. does this even do anything?
  - have the cssInjectedByJsPlugin inject CSS on a data attribute on some element.
    - actaully first, verify if we even need this with emitCss.

- consider using filters from NSE, or write my own. doesn't look too hard.
