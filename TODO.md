# TODO

- put images (gifs?) in the README

- fine tune light-mode. it's taken the back seat during development.

- revisit rich tag. we should be using the props on the elements, not doing
  query selections, etc.

- not a dialog container, but dialog elements per dialog. use shadcn-svelte's
  dialog component. this should help with our autofocus woes.

- small screen size responsiveness...everywhere

- nav sheet is janked. fix up.

- scroll to top button
