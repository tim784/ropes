# TODO

- put images (gifs?) in the README

- fine tune light-mode. it's taken the back seat during development. In fact, we
  should probably just settle on a theme from
  <https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/themes>

- small screen nav menu shelf could use a styling pass. button spacing, etc.

- small screen widths should breakpoint the size of the torrent cards?
